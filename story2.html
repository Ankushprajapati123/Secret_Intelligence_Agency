                While peer-to-peer networks are mainly used to locate unique resources across the Internet, new interesting
                deployment scenarios are emerging. Particularly, some applications (e.g., VoIP) are proposing the creation of overlays
                for the localization of services based on equivalent servants (e.g., voice relays). This paper explores the possible
                overlay architectures that can be adopted to provide such services, showing how an unstructured solution based on a
                scale-free overlay topology is an effective option to deploy in this context. Consequently, we propose EQUATOR
                (Equivalent servant locator), an unstructured overlay implementing the above-mentioned operating principles, based on
                an overlay construction algorithm that well approximates an ideal scale-free construction model.
